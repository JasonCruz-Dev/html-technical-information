              Our attitude in the job place is extremely important while at work. Our Customers and Employees DO matter and take pride in giving them the best service possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              When working with customers all day, answering phone calls & doing repair work; we can find ourselves pretty preoccupied. Sometimes alittle short with customers. Not fully engaing with them because we are wrapped up wth completing everything else. We
              want to do things differently.
            </p>
            <p>Here are some ways you can try and remember to do while assisting or attending to customers:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Address the customer with complete Respect and Dignity, answer yes sir, no sir. Just rolling with ideas.
              </li>
              <li>
                (more can be filled in here.)
